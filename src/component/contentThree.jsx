            <p>
              Bakery started in 2010 as two friends <br />
              searching for the perfect balance of flour, <br />
              water, and salt. Loam Bakery now sells a daily <br />
              selection of breads and pastries both online <br />
              and in-store.
            </p>
            <p>
              We have a philosophy of balance—a balance of <br />
              old techniques and new ones, of different <br />
              ingredients and flavors, and of passion and <br />
              skill.

            <h1>Our ingredients</h1>
            <p>
            We work with 14 local farmers to source all of the <br />
             grains, fruit, and dairy that go into our breads and <br />
              pastries. Our bread is human—from the farmers who <br />
               mill and harvest our grains, to the bakers who put <br />
                passion and care into each loaf they make.
